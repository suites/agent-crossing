# LangGraph Migration Spike

## Goal

- Check which existing backend concepts can be reconstituted as LangGraph state, nodes, edges, or subgraphs.
- Keep world/runtime authority and custom memory scoring in the current backend.
- Make the first migration step small, reversible, and behavior-preserving.

## Branch

- `spike/langgraph-feasibility`

## Repo-specific LangGraph candidates

| `packages/backend/src/agents/agent_brain.py`           | top-level agent graph        | P2       | Possible later, but too wide for a first migration step because it mixes memory writes, reflection, and action side effects. |
| `packages/backend/src/agents/planning/planner.py`      | planning subgraph entrypoint | P2       | Good future fit once planning is more complete and world-wired.                                                              |

## Proposed migration order

1. **Reaction pipeline seam**
   - Introduce a LangGraph wrapper around the current reaction pipeline.
   - Preserve current output behavior.
   - Keep the existing `LlmGateway.decide_reaction()` interface unchanged.
2. **Reaction node split**
   - Break the legacy reaction callable into explicit LangGraph nodes: intent, utterance, semantic guard, overlap guard, finalize.
3. **Reflection subgraph**
   - Move question generation and insight generation orchestration into LangGraph.
   - Keep retrieval, persistence, citation validation, and importance counter reset in backend code.
4. **Optional AgentBrain composition**
   - Evaluate whether `AgentBrain.action_loop()` should become a higher-level graph after the inner subgraphs are proven.

## First implementation step

### Scope

- Add LangGraph as a backend dependency.
- Add a `reaction_graph` module that compiles a tiny `StateGraph` around the current reaction decision call.
- Route `ReactionPipeline.decide_reaction()` through that graph while preserving behavior.

### Why this first

- Smallest blast radius.
- Existing tests already cover reaction behavior.
- Gives concrete evidence that LangGraph can sit at a stable adapter seam before we split the logic into smaller nodes.

## Validation checklist

- Existing reaction unit tests still pass.
- New graph wrapper unit test passes.
- No changes to world/runtime/session behavior.
- No changes to memory scoring or persistence contracts.
